            Hello! My name is Jake, and I'm a creative and technical writer. I've always had a passion for writing, but I started my academic career studying computer engineering. I moved on to become a Professional and Technical Writing Major, but many of my technical and computer skills are still sharp and refined. My personal experiences have helped me to draft serious technical documents, specifically engineering documents, with a broader audience in mind, to bring specialized knowledge to the general crowd. When it comes to creative writing, I love writing anything long form, and specialize in writing romantic fiction as well as dramatic fiction. One day I'd like to go into the gaming industry, either writing games, or working in a lore department, as world-building is quite fascinating. In my spare time, I like to listen to classical music, binge Netflix, and develop my farm on Stardew Valley. I look forward to working with you!
